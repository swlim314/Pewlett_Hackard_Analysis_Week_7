# Analysis of Retiring Employees at Pewlett Hackard
## Overview of Data Analyzed
I was tasked to determine the number of retiring employees at Pewlett Hackard, based on their current  title, as well as identify
employees who are currently eligible to participate in a mentorship program. To do this analysis, I was required to create several tables
using inner joins to map out employees and their titles and keeping a count on that. After these tables were created, another table was
required to identify elgibile employees for the mentorship program. This again required several inner joins based on the employees and
department employees tables, as well as with the employees and the titles table. After the inner joins, they were filtered by only
including current employees, and those that were born in the year 1965.
## Results of the Analysis
### Number of Retiring Employees
- One major finding from the analysis on retiring employees was the large amount of retiring employees that were experienced/senior. There
were more than double the amount of Senior Engineers (29,414) and Senior Staff (28,254) than Engineer (14,222) and Staff (12,243). This is
shown in the image below.
